# S.O.L.I.D Principles #

### Single Responsibility ###

- [x] separate class for outputting area/volume

### Open-Closed ###

- [x] no need to modify the calculator classes when adding a new figure class

### Liskov Substitution ###

- [ ] a class should be substitutable for their parent class

### Interface Segregation ###

- [x] a new shape will not be forced to implement area AND volume calculation

### Dependency Inversion ###

- [ ] a high level module should not depend on a low level module but they should depend on abstractions
